# Doubly-Linked-List
## Java Doubly Linked List
* Doubly Linked List has both <b>next</b> and <b>previous</b> references.
  * It is a linear data structure where each node contains the data, reference to the next node, and reference to the previous node.
* They contain sentinel nodes namely the header and the trailer, which are empty.
* Unlike Singly Linked List, you can traverse forward and backward.
* Here are some important methods in doubly linked list:
  * <code>void addFirst()</code>
  * <code>Node<T> addBefore(Node<T> node, T element)</code>
  * <code>Node<T> addAfter(Node<T> node, T element)</code>
  * <code>T remove(Node<T> node)</code>
